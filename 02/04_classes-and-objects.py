# Complete implementation of three methods
# 
#  __init__ should take an argument "name". It should initialize self.name to the argument and self.items to be an empty list
#
# add_item should append a dictionary representing an item to the store's items property. The dictionary should have keys name and price.
#
# stock_price should add up each item price inside self.items to come up with a total and return that

class Store:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def add_item(self, name, price):
        pass

    def stock_price(self):
        pass
